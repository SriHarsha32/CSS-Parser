# CSS-Parser
Most documents on the Web are styled using the **W3C standard langugage - CSS**. 
CSS has its own set of rules or grammar which has to be
followed while styling any document. Our CSS validator is to help people validate their
CSS document, and fix if necessary guided by our error detecting system. If you are a
Web developer or a Web designer, this tool will be an invaluable ally. Not only will it
compare your style sheets to the CSS specifications, helping you find errors, typos, or
incorrect uses of CSS, it will also tell youÂ which type of CSS selector is applied at which
particular line.

CSS is an evolving language, and it is considered by many that CSS is a single
grammar (the one defined in the latest specification) with a number of properties and
acceptable values defined in various profiles. In a future version of this validator, the
default behavior may be to check style sheets against that latest CSS grammar and the
cloud of all standardized CSS properties and values.
